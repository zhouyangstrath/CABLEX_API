Fitness Function
================

The power cable shapes are evaluated regarding the maximum
efective tension and the maximum curvature in together with some additional criteria in tether
and clamp design. The criteria are combined
in a ftness function, normalized by their maximum allowable value:
with

FF = Tmax/MBL + Cmax/MAC + Pt/Nor

• MBL = Minimum Breaking Load
• MAC = Maximum Allowable Curvature
• Nor = Specified tether properties

both including a safety factor of 1.3. Using the fitness
function, an Power Cable confguration with lower ftness value
is considered to be better. In the following section, numerous diferent confgurations of each shape are examined in
a parametric study, with the ftness value being the central
decision criterion.
