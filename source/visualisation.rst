Please make sure your data is correctly loaded and saved under the identical documentaion with the
**CABLEX.exe** file, the file format should be :file:`Offsets_MarineGrowth_LoadingSpace_Cable_Buoy.txt`

On the left section of the CABLEX UI, the data source is shown at the very top, represents different
Offsets, Marine Growth, Loading Space and Buoy/Cable you have selected for the specific problem(site),

Offsets:
::
    Norminal: 0% WaterDepth fairlead displacement 
    Near/Far/Cross: 30% WaterDepth fairlead displacement 

Marine Growth:
::

    SOL: Start of life
    EOL: End of life


Following behind it is the visualisation plan, or the parameters need to be specified to define the x-axis
and y-axis of the plot, you can select whatever you want from the DS loadings. 

At the bottom of the sections is the Contour plots, you can select the parameters you want to plot, i.e.,
pass plot, top angle contour plot, top tension contour plot, minimum bend radius contour plot.

On the right hand side, it is the criteria you can specify for your designs, there are differnet criteria used 
for not only static but also dynamic analysis.

Located at the right bottom section would be the function button.
