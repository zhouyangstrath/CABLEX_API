Post Processing
===============

The post-calculation actions are adopted during the hydrodynamic modeling and simulation 
inside Orcaflex. Multiple modules and functions are introduced in the code to either 
extract the necessary data or adapt different criteria under various loading conditions.

No further actions or post-processing scripts are needed for the data required by the CABLEX User Interface.

The code can be accessed through:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd UK-FDT-Tools\PowerCable\CABLEX\PostCalculation


Since the post-processing files are correlated with corresponding Orcaflex .sim/dat files, 
a data summarization work is required to assemble the results.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd UK-FDT-Tools\PowerCable\CABLEX\DataSum
