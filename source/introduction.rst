Introduction
============

Dynamic Inter Array Cable (DIAC) is regarded as critical subsea transmission components for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine (FOWT) technologies, 
therefore, the design requirements for the DIAC must be able to withstand extreme metocean environments and cyclic fatigue damage. For DIAC designs, 
TFMC has strong expertise in North/Celtic Sea Projects and is capable of reproducing the entire DIAC system when faced with different clients 
specifications. However, prioritizing access to a more comprehensive knowledgebase/database is essential when encountering various scenarios in DIAC 
design to ensure the development of a robust and cost-efficient system. To this end, Power Cable Design Tool CABLEX provided an advanced process and 
high-level methodology to aid TFMC during pre-feed and detailed-design process with a fully automated and generic process.
