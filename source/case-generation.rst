Case Generation
===============

The process of case generation in CABLEX involves utilizing client/TFMC-provided inputs
to establish a base model under Orcaflex. This can be usually set up based on previous successful projects

Input Files
------------

Before initiating the case generation, ensure you have the necessary input files from the client. These files typically include:

- Site conditions
- RNA and floater geometries
- RNA and floater Gross properties
- Metocean data
- Client specifications
- Cable Buoy Clamp Tether BS selection

Establishing the Base Model
---------------------------

Once the input files are available, the base model is established following these steps:

1. **Site Conditions**: Incorporate the provided site conditions into the model.
2. **RNA and Floater Geometries**: Integrate the RNA and floater geometries into the base model.
3. **Gross Properties**: Include the gross properties specified by the client.
4. **Metocean Data**: Integrate metocean data for the given site into the model.
5. **Client Specifications**: Ensure that the model adheres to all client specifications.
6. **Cable Buoy Clamp Tether BS selection** Implement the properties of selection in a specified file
